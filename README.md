Joshua Project API
------------------

An API for connecting to the [Joshua Project](http://www.joshuaproject.net) data.  It uses the [PHP Slim Framework](http://slimframework.com). Still under construction.

Development
-----------
This repository is following the branching technique described in [this blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the semantic version set out on the [Semantic Versioning Website](http://semver.org/).

This tool uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install the project specific libraries.  We also use [Swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/) annotations for generating the front facing API documentation.

Questions or problems? Please post them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MissionalDigerati/vts_cakephp_plugin/issues). You can contribute changes by forking the project and submitting a pull request.
